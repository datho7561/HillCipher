# HILL CIPHER

A simple program that takes letters and encodes them using the Hill Cipher, with
a randomly generated matrix. This program uses a 2x2 matrix to encode, and adds
characters to the end of the string in order to make the string an even number
of characters long.

This program is built to be run from the command line.
